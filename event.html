            About The Run
        </h1>
            <p>
                    The Pride of Dharwad is the ideal venue for bringing together runners and all citizens to celebrate their running journey. Over the years, running in Bharat has increased exponentially, and Dharwad is one of the cities part of this transformation. 
                    The running community in Dharwad is budding and is all bound to grow more in the coming years.
                    Dharwad is all set for its first edition of Dharwad Half Marathon, which will pass by significant local landmarks. We think this event will significantly increase the visibility of running in the city and  encourage a fit and healthy lifestyle.
